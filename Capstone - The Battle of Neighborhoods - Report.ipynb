A friend of mine is planning to move to NY and wants to live in Brooklyn. However, she does not know what neighborhoods are similar and what kind of venues can be found in each location. The following project intends to put some light into the different similar neighborhoods in Brooklyn and to cluster them according to their characteristics in order to give the best recommendation to my friend.\nThis project can also be used in the future by any other person interested in moving to a new city without having enough information about the different neighborhoods."
